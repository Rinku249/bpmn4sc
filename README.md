Abandoned project regarding the translation between BPMN and DAML. The translation occurs using a file with the extension .bpmn and the output is created in the output DAML folder.

The project was abadoned due to the futility of the translation efforts between BPMN and DAML, more information can be found in my thesis dissertation.

To use the code, parser.js has to be called and the first argument after it is the file to be opened.
